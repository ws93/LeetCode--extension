# 195. Tenth Line

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/tenth-line/)

How would you print just the 10th line of a file?

For example, assume that `file.txt` has the following content:

<pre>Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
Line 4
Line 5
Line 6
Line 7
Line 8
Line 9
Line 10
</pre>

Your script should output the tenth line, which is:

<pre>Line 10
</pre>
