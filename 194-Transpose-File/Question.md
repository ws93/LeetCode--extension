# 194. Transpose File

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/transpose-file/)

Given a text file `file.txt`, transpose its content.

You may assume that each row has the same number of columns and each field is separated by the `' '` character.

For example, if `file.txt` has the following content:

<pre>name age
alice 21
ryan 30
</pre>

Output the following:

<pre>name alice ryan
age 21 30
</pre>
